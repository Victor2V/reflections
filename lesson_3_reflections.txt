	1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to use remote repository when i'm  need access from another devices or collaborate 
with other developers.
	2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual pull allows control over published versions of files

Fork used on GitHub remote repo, clone used for creating local repo from remote and branch allow various versions 
of files chaining from master branch

While having a local copy of the remote repo IO have access to last versions/modifications of shared files

I have to think about it a little
